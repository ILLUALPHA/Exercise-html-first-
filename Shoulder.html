   <h2>Shoulder</h2>
   <p>The shoulder is an exercise that intervenes no matter what kind of exercise you do.<br>
      When you do back exercise, chest exercise, or arm exercise, the shoulder becomes a natural exercise.
      Shoulder exercise is also included when exercising the lower body.<br>
      Nevertheless, the reason for exercising the shoulder separately is
      that shoulder exercise has a great effect of widening the frame and making the upper body look better.<br>
      When doing shoulder exercises for the first time, starting the military press (overhead press) first
      rather than doing exercises such as side lateral raises helps a lot in shoulder growth. The military press is almost identical to the bench press in chest exercise.
      You can exercise using all shoulder muscles.<br>
      The shoulder is divided into three muscles, front, side, and rear.
      If you develop these three muscles with the military press and cut them through other exercises, you can make better shoulder muscles.<br>
      If you exercise with your arms raised, there is a high risk of injury to your shoulders, so stretching and exercising with your body warm can reduce the risk of injury.
