   <h2>Arm</h2>
   <p>The arms belong to the small muscles.
      Speaking of the large muscles in the body, the back, chest, and thighs belong to the large muscles.
      The arms are divided into biceps and triceps,
      and they work together when you exercise your back, chest, and lower body. It is similar to the shoulder.
      I don't like to exercise my arms.
      This is because, when the intervention of small muscles increases, the large muscles do not feel much stimulation.
      The arms are also said to be the most masculine part of the body.
      However, it is said that if the arm gets bigger due to a lot of arm exercise, the rotation of the upper body decreases.
      I don't do much arm exercise because I want efficient and fluid muscles and body. I will do it again.
