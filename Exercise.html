   <p>In my opinion, exercise has the purpose of making the body beautiful,
      but it is also a means to steadily improving oneself.<br>
      If I exercise on a day when I do nothing, I feel like I have grown today.<br>
      Rather than challenging with a short-term goal,
      pursue an exercise that you can consistently work hard for.<br>
      I hope it will be an exercise that brings vitality to life.
      How nice it is to have work to do every day!<br>
      There are so many things to say about exercise, so I briefly explained each part.<br>
      Let's make exercise easy and fun!
