   <h2>Chest</h2>
   <p>Chest exercise is mainly made by using the pushing force. If women ask men where they feel masculine,
      I want to say that it is Chest. It is said that women feel a lot of masculine beauty to men with wide chest.<br>
      That doesn't mean you can't feel masculine in other parts, though.
      There are many chest exercises such as push-ups, bench presses, incline presses, and dips.<br>
      Among them, it is helpful for beginners to first develop chest muscles to some extent through push-ups and dips and then perform exercises such as bench press and incline to feel chest stimulation.
      If you try, you will not feel the stimulation well, and there is a risk of injury.<br>
      After doing some push-ups, you can start with the bench press, which is the flower of your chest exercise.<br>
      The bench press is the most effective exercise that stimulates all parts of the chest, so it is a good idea to include it in your exercise.
      And you can fill in the gaps with dips or incline press.<br>
      If you want to show off your masculine beauty, let's work hard on the chest.</p>
